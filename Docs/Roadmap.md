# Roadmap

## v0.3 (SPH core)
- uniform grid hashing + sorting for neighbor search
- density compute: rho_i = Σ m W(r,h)
- EOS pressure (weakly compressible SPH)
- pressure + viscosity forces
- minimum-image convention for dx in X

## v0.4 (quality)
- boundary improvements near solids (boundary particles or pressure extrapolation)
- vorticity confinement (optional visual turbulence)
- better particle spawn distribution and presets
